# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of The Analysis
In this project our task was to build an employee database with SQL by applying data modeling, engineering and analysis skills.  We had two questions to answer: determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
In the first deliverable we created a table that included all current employees who are born between January 1, 1952 and December 31,1955 who are approaching retirement age.

We then created a table with the count of the number of employees that are retiring and their titles.

In the second deliverable we created a table that included all current employees who are born between January 1, 1965 to December 31, 1965 that are eligible for a mentorship program.

## Summary
There are over 50,000 roles to fill as the â€œsilver tsunami starts, however there is a bright side since the company has a lot of employees who are eligible to be in the mentorship program hence being able to train the influx of new hires
